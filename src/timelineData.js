        title: "Roots of the Festival",
        description: "The roots of CAAMFest can be traced back to Asian CineVision (ACV) in New York, as well as The release of \"Chan is Missing\" (1981) by Wayne Wang. The National Asian American Telecommunications Association (NAATA) was founded in 1980 to address the negative stereotypes of Asian Americans on screen, in the same spirit as ACV. The success of \"Chan is Missing\" stimulated the Asian American film community, and a year after the film’s release, ACV and NAATA collaborated to form the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival in 1982. Some films that were featured at the very first SFIAAFF include \"Mirror Points\" by Ruby Yang, \"Manongs\" by Curtis Choy and Chris Chow, and several of Sessue Hayakawa’s films as part of a retrospective on his career. NAATA and ACV would continue to collaborate until 1985.",

        title: "A New Journey",
        description: "After a short break in 1985 to focus on organizing the National Asian American Media Arts Conference at UCLA, NAATA came back to the Bay Area to take full charge of the SFIAAFF. The festival was no longer simply a part of ACV, but its own separate entity, marking the start of a new journey for the festival. Due to a scarcity of Asian American films at the time, the festival would often feature films from Asian filmmakers, typically from China. From here on, the SFIAAFF continued to grow at a rapid pace, and by the festival’s run in 1994, over 100 works were showcased.",

        description: "The 23rd run of SFIAAFF saw an increase in quality Asian American and Canadian works. Festival Director Chi-hui Yang and Assistant Director Taro Goto made the decision to add competitive categories for Best Asian American Feature and Best Asian American Documentary, among other audience awards. CAAMFest thus became a launchpad for Asian American Independent filmmakers to kickstart their career. CAAMFest23 opened with \"Saving Face\" (2004) by Alice Wu and closed with \"The Motel\" (2005) by Michael Kang.",

        description: "SFIAAFF originally started out only showcasing Asian American films, but slowly began including films from Asian filmmakers around the world as well. The festival also began attracting a large number of non-Asian audiences. With the expansion of the festival, NAATA officially rebranded to the Center of Asian American Media (CAAM). Similarly, SFIAAFF became known as CAAMFest. That year, CAAMFest began including food, music, and digital media alongside its curated showcase of films. ",

Around 30,000 patrons attended the festival and viewed 126 works, a far cry from the 13 works that were originally shown at the very first SFIAAFF. At the festival, Warner Bros. Pictures collaborated with CAAMFest to present an event in which \"Crazy Rich Asians\" (2018) director Jon M. Chu showed never-before-seen clips from his film. Sundance award-winning film \"Minding the Gap\" (2018) by Bing Liu was also screened at CAAMFest36.",
